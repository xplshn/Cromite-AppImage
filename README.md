# cromite-AppImage

AppImage made using [sharun](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun), which makes it extremely easy to turn any binary into a portable package without using containers or similar tricks (This one wasn't easy though). 

**This AppImage bundles everything and should work on any linux distro, even on musl based ones.**

**It also uses the [uruntime](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/uruntime) which makes use of dwarfs, resulting in a smaller and faster AppImage.**

It is possible that this appimage may fail to work with appimagelauncher, I recommend this alternative instead: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM

This AppImage works without fuse2 as it can use fuse3 instead.
